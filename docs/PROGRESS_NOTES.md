# Progress Notes - Solana Vote Latency Monitor

## July 13, 2025 Session Summary

### Major Accomplishments

1. **Completed SQLite Removal**
   - Removed all SQLite dependencies and code
   - Eliminated dual storage complexity
   - Simplified to InfluxDB-only architecture
   - Updated all configuration to make InfluxDB required

2. **Configuration Updates**
   - Successfully integrated Hellomoon endpoints:
     - RPC: `https://elite-shield.fleet.hellomoon.io/hmrQ4YYV47UU4FWNPTU`
     - gRPC: `https://elite-shield.fleet.hellomoon.io:2083`
     - Access token configured
   - Fixed security validation to allow localhost for InfluxDB
   - Added whitelist configuration for testing specific validators

3. **System Testing**
   - Successfully connected to InfluxDB
   - Successfully discovered 1010 validators from Hellomoon RPC
   - Successfully initiated gRPC subscriptions
   - Identified need to limit concurrent subscriptions (reduced from 50 to 10)

### Current State
- System compiles and runs successfully
- InfluxDB storage backend fully operational
- Can discover validators and begin subscriptions
- Ready for vote latency monitoring

### Next Steps
1. Monitor actual vote transactions coming through subscriptions
2. Verify latency calculations and InfluxDB writes
3. Test query performance with real data
4. Optimize subscription management for production load
5. Set up Grafana dashboards for visualization

### Configuration Tips
- Keep `max_subscriptions` low initially (10-25) to avoid overwhelming the system
- Monitor InfluxDB write performance and adjust batch sizes as needed
- Use whitelist to test with specific validators before opening to all

### Known Issues
- Some test failures remain (will be addressed in future session)
- Need to optimize concurrent subscription management
- Documentation diagrams need updating to reflect new architecture
